## About this project
###
This is the beginning of a node seed project which is the skeleton of a full blown backend that can be easy for newcomers
to get started with and can scale easily for simple or complex applications.

### Testing suggestion
Only write tests for the service layer, and dont include any logic at the api level.
That makes it easy to have high test coverage and not have to worry about what should I test?
